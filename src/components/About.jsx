          About Me
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          I am a technically driven engineer with strong foundations in
          artificial intelligence, mathematics, and full-stack development.
          I enjoy building intelligent systems that translate theory into
          real-world impact, especially in areas involving data-driven
          decision making and applied research.
